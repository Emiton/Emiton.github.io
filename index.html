  <h1>Welcome to Emiton.io!</h1>
  <p>My name is Emiton and I am an engineer who focuses on building production grade software and prototyping electromechanical systems.</p>
  <p>I work primarily as a software engineer in the R&D space for Amazon. I work as a fullstack engineer, who's current focus is 70% backend engineering, distributed systems, and high scalability. I also do front-end client facing work and I love delivering products with inuitive interfaces.</p>
  <p>Although I love writing code, I see the technology as an accessory for problem solving. I love creating value add systems which are resilient and promote growth for several different classes of people. I know this sounds a bit abstract, but whether I am putting together a community meetup or designing a high throughput data streaming service, the goal is still the same: To empower people and to create an environment which promotes success by way of effectively incentivizing users and creators alike. In a community meetup this may be achieved through establishing proper communication channels and standards of communication. In a distributed system, this can be influenced by architecture design and making developer productivity a first class citizen during discussions.</p>
  <p> My background includes a BS in Mechanical Engineering, a MS in Computer Science, data infrastructure at Twitter, mobile applications for the state of Massachusetts, robotics infrastructure at Amazon Robotics, full stack engineering for Amazon Go, real estate management and investing, small business management, and community engagement.</p>
